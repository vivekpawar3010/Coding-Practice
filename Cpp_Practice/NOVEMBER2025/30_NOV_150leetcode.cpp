// According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

// The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
// The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.

// Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.

// Note that you do not need to return anything.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
// Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
// Example 2:


// Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
// Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

// Constraints:

// m == board.length
// n == board[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 25
// board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
